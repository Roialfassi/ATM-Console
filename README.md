# ATM Console Program üè¶

## Overview
This Python console application simulates an **ATM machine**, allowing customers to perform banking transactions such as:
- Checking balance
- Withdrawing cash
- Depositing cash
- Changing their password

The application securely loads customer data from a file (`customers.json`) and updates it upon exit to maintain changes.
